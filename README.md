## Stronklifts at a Glance

Stronklifts is a fullstack [PERN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-pern-stack/) single page app that allows the user to track their workout progress while following the 5x5 powerlifting program. 

Users can interact with a graph of their progress over time for multiple exercises used in the 5x5 program.

Users can complete individual workouts with a few clicks without ever thinking about what weight they should be lifting. Programmatic progession (adding weight) and deloading (removing weight) is done automatically.
